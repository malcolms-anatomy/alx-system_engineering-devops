## Postmortem: The Great Load Balancer Fiasco of 2024

### Issue Summary
**Duration of the Outage:** June 15, 2024, 14:00 - 17:30 GMT

**Impact:** 
Imagine a bustling party where suddenly 80% of the guests are locked out, while the remaining 20% are stuck with soggy nachos. Thatâ€™s what our users experiencedâ€”80% were hit with 503 Service Unavailable errors or painfully slow response times. Essential services like login, data retrieval, and form submissions were MIA.

**Root Cause:** 
A tiny misconfiguration in the load balancer settings threw a wrench into the works, overloading a few servers while the others had a siesta.

### Timeline
- **14:00 GMT:** Our Spidey-sense (aka monitoring system) tingledâ€”high response times and error rates detected.
- **14:05 GMT:** Engineers sprang into action, capes flapping in the wind.
- **14:15 GMT:** Suspected villain: the database (recently updated and shady-looking).
- **14:30 GMT:** Database team combed through logs and metricsâ€”nothing to see here, folks.
- **15:00 GMT:** Next suspect: code deployment. Rolled back changes like hitting the undo button.
- **15:30 GMT:** Rollback complete, but the chaos continued.
- **16:00 GMT:** Network team to the rescueâ€”spotted uneven traffic distribution across servers.
- **16:15 GMT:** Identified the true culprit: load balancer configuration.
- **16:30 GMT:** Correct configuration applied, servers back in action.
- **17:00 GMT:** System performance began to normalize.
- **17:30 GMT:** Full service restored, celebration ensued.

### Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:**
Our load balancer, misconfigured during routine maintenance, became the bouncer from hellâ€”sending a flood of traffic to a few servers while ignoring the rest. Result? Server overload and user frustration.

**Resolution:**
With the true villain unmasked, the network team swooped in and reconfigured the load balancer, ensuring traffic was evenly spread. Think of it like redistributing guests evenly at the partyâ€”everyoneâ€™s happy and munching on fresh nachos again.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Patch the Load Balancer Configuration:** Double-check, triple-checkâ€”letâ€™s avoid another gatecrasher situation.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** More sensors (aka monitoring and alerts) to detect these issues early.
3. **Documentation and Training:** Update the how-to guide and hold a superhero training camp for the network team.

**Tasks:**
- Apply the correct load balancer configuration immediately.
- Add granular monitoring for load balancer metrics.
- Review and update the maintenance procedure documentation.
- Conduct training sessions for the network team.
- Schedule regular audits of load balancer settings post-maintenance.
